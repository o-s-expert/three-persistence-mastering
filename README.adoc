= The three goals to achieve the Java persistence mastering
:toc: auto

== 1 Business

* The reason that we're coding is the goal.

Software Engineer Definition by  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLXCXT3R/[Modern Software Engineering's] book:

> Software Engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software.

* Rich vs Anemic model

=== DDD

* Bringing the code close to the business.
* There are tactical and strategic perspectives

* *Strategic*: it's a business language: Bounded Context, ubiquitous language, context Maps.
* *Tactical*: implementation, classes, and modules.

==== Patterns

* Entities: Anything with continuity through a life cycle and distinctions independent of attributes essential to the application's user.
* Aggregator:  A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
* Value Object: Value Object is an object that represents a concept from your problem Domain.
* Services: is used to perform domain operations and business rules
* Repository: is used to access data from persistent stores.

==== Books

=== Understanding and converting to the code

There are several, such as story Storming, Story Mapping, and UML. My favorite one is Domain storytelling.

== 2 Isolation

* We are keeping the business safe from technology.

* Hexagonal architecture
* Ports and Adaptors
* https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134494164[Clean Architecture]

=== Abstraction

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR3RXFW2/[Just enough software Architecture: A risk-driven Approach]:

> To be successful at combating the scale and complexity of software in the next decade, developers will need improved weapons... in three categories: partitioning, knowledge, and *abstraction*.

> *Abstraction* can effectively combat complexity and scale because it shrinks problems, and smaller problems are easier to reason about it.

=== Layers, Layers, Layers

* Unstructured Code Monolith
* Modular Monolith
* Layered Architecture
** Mapper
** DAO
** Repository

=== When Layer can become an enemy

More code:

* More Work
* More code to maintain
* More bugs
* We're terrible at seeing the future; go to evolutionary architecture instead.
** Unknown unknowns

== 3 Performance

* Object-relational impedance mismatch
** Polymorphism, types, conversion, mapper
** 90% is on that conversion

=== Take advantage of the database

> Hibernate and JPA were designed to work well in combination with handwritten SQL.

* NoSQL
** Key-value
** Wide-column
** Document
** Graph
** Time Series
** Even more
* SQL
* NewSQL
* CAP
** PACELC

=== Models

https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321826620/[NoSQL Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Emerging World of Polyglot Persistence]

=== Challenges (Leak of knowledge)

* Maturity Models
* Design Patterns
** Migrations
* CDC

== Conclusion

Understand the three rules and focus on simplicity.
